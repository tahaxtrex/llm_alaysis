## Key issues found
- The document begins with "Application Questions" from a previous chapter, which creates an abrupt and confusing start for the reader of this specific extract.

## Suggested fixes
- Ensure that document extracts begin at the natural start of a chapter or module, or clearly label the initial "Application Questions" as belonging to a preceding chapter.

## Evidence (short quotes)
- "156 4 • Application Questions" (appears at the very beginning of the document, before the Chapter 5 outline)
- "In the field of cybersecurity—which is the practice of protecting systems, networks, devices, and data from online threats—information security and information privacy are not identical terms, although they are related." (example of jargon definition)
- "Think of information security as a bouncer at a club. Its job is to keep unwanted guests out, so it uses tools such as encryption to hide the important data, firewalls to block unauthorized entry, and secure networks to chase away any intruders." (example of relatable analogy)
- "In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack exploited a vulnerability that could have been mitigated with proper security configurations." (example of concrete, real-world incident)
- "By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Determine the difference between information security and information privacy on a public or private network" (example of clear learning objectives)
